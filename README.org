#+TITLE: blocker - Domain blocker plugin for CoreDNS

=blocker= is a CoreDNS plugin which can be used to block a list of domains provided in the
=/etc/hosts= file format. The blocklist will be loaded into memory at start-up and the file's
modified time will be checked periodically. When the blocklist file is updated, the in-memory
blocklist will be updated by scanning the blocklist file.

Updating the blocklist file is beyond the scope of this plugin. I recommend a bash script which
downloads [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts][common]] [[http://hosts.oisd.nl/][blocklists]] and updates them into a format without comments.  The script
[[file:blocklist-file-preparer.sh]] included with this repository is an example of how this can be done
using bash and GNU utils.

*Example blocklist file:* ([[https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Hosts-Blocklists#adblock-style][AdBlock Plus syntax]])

* Usage

** CoreDNS Binary

You can include blocker in your CoreDNS just as you would include any other CoreDNS plugin.

#+begin_src sh
  # Clone coredns to a local location
  $ git clone git@github.com:coredns/coredns.git ~/dns-server/coredns

  # Clone blocker plugin to a close location
  $ git clone git@github.com:icyflame/blocker.git ~/dns-server/blocker

  # Symlink blocker location into coredns/plugin/blocker
  $ cd ~/dns-server/coredns/plugin
  $ ln -s ../blocker ./blocker

  # Update plugin.cfg and put the line "blocker:blocker" before the "forward:forward" line

  # Build CoreDNS
  $ cd ~/dns-server/coredns
  $ go generate
  $ make
  $ ./coredns -conf Corefile
#+end_src

** Corefile

The =blocker= directive inside Corefile requires two arguments. The first argument is the absolute
path to the blocklist file. The second argument is the frequency at which the blocklist file is
checked for updates.

The frequency is specified as a string and the value should be a valid argument to the
[[https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration][time.ParseDuration]] function.

#+begin_src conf
  blocker /home/user/blocklist_file 1h abp
#+end_src

This is a sample Corefile including the =blocker= directive. It will block domains that are
specified in the blocklist and forward everything else to a full DNS server.

#+begin_src conf
  .:53 {
	metadata

	# prometheus records metrics regarding incoming requests
	prometheus

	# log writes 1 line to the log for every DNS request
	# The last word in the log line will be YES if the request was blocked and NO if it was not
	# blocked.
	# This behaviour is supported by the metadata plugin.
	log . "{common} {/blocker/request-blocked}"

	# blocker blocks domains which are specified in the blocklist
	blocker /home/user/blocklist_file 1h hosts

	# forward handles any request that is not blocked by blocker
	forward . 127.0.0.1:9053
  }
#+end_src

** plugin.cfg

This is a sample middleware configuration file. The order of plugins here is important. This is the
order in which plugins will be executed for incoming requests.

#+begin_src conf
  metadata:metadata
  prometheus:metrics
  log:log
  blocker:blocker
  forward:forward
#+end_src
